# Random Mouse Movement Script

This is a Python script that uses the `pyautogui` library to move the mouse cursor to random coordinates within a specified range at regular intervals. It's a simple demonstration of how you can control the mouse cursor programmatically.

## Getting Started

To run this script, you need to have Python and the `pyautogui` library installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/MusaTahawar/random-mouse-movement.git
    cd random-mouse-movement
    ```

2. **Run the script**:

    ```shell
    python random_mouse_movement.py
    ```

The script will continuously move the mouse cursor to random positions within the specified range (600, 700) for the X-coordinate and (200, 600) for the Y-coordinate. It will sleep for 2 seconds between each movement.

## Purpose

This script can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Demonstrating how to control the mouse cursor using Python and the `pyautogui` library.
- Simulating user activity for testing and automation purposes.
- Creating visual effects or artistic displays by moving the cursor randomly.

## Customization

You can customize the script by changing the range and sleep duration in the code to fit your specific needs.
